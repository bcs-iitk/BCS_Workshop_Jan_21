        "In this tutorial, we'll build a deep learning model to decode stimulus information from the responses of sensory neurons. Specifically, we'll look at the activity of ~20,000 neurons in mouse primary visual cortex responding to oriented gratings recorded in [this study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/679324v2.abstract). Our task is to decode the orientation of the presented stimulus from the responses of the whole population of neurons.\n",

        "We will start by learning how to build a deep feed-forward network using PyTorch. We will then evaluate the network's outputs using PyTorch's built-in loss functions. After that we will see how gradients of the loss function are related to each parameter of the network and compute them using automatic differentiation\n",
